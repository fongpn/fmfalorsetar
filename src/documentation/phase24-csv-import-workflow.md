# Phase 24: CSV Import Workflow

## Overview
This phase outlines the planned workflow for CSV data imports, focusing on a multi-step process that allows users to review, validate, and modify data before committing it to the database. This approach ensures data integrity while providing flexibility for handling exceptions and edge cases.

## Planned Import Workflow

### 1. File Upload
- **CSV Selection**: User uploads a CSV file via drag-and-drop or file browser
- **Initial Validation**: System checks file format, size, and basic structure
- **Header Verification**: Confirms required columns are present
- **Feedback**: Immediate response if file format is invalid

### 2. Data Preview & Validation
- **Tabular Display**: Data presented in an interactive table format
- **Validation Processing**: Each row checked against business rules
- **Error Highlighting**: Invalid cells highlighted with error indicators
- **Warning Indicators**: Potential issues flagged with warnings
- **Summary Statistics**: Overview of valid, invalid, and warning counts

### 3. Data Correction
- **Inline Editing**: Users can directly edit cells in the preview table
- **Bulk Operations**: Apply changes to multiple rows simultaneously
- **Auto-Correction**: Suggestions for common formatting issues
- **Row Exclusion**: Option to exclude specific rows from import
- **Re-validation**: Immediate feedback as corrections are made

### 4. Column Mapping
- **Header Matching**: System attempts to match CSV headers with database fields
- **Manual Mapping**: User can adjust mappings if automatic matching fails
- **Required Fields**: Clear indication of which mappings are required
- **Default Values**: Option to set default values for missing columns

### 5. Import Confirmation
- **Final Review**: Summary of data to be imported
- **Impact Assessment**: Overview of how import will affect existing data
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual feedback during import process

### 6. Results & Reporting
- **Success Summary**: Count of successfully imported records
- **Error Report**: Details of any records that failed to import
- **Download Option**: Ability to download error report for offline correction
- **Action Options**: Clear next steps (e.g., retry failed records, continue to member list)

## Validation Rules

### Member Data Validation
- **Member ID**: 
  - Must be unique in the system
  - Should follow 4-digit format (e.g., "0001")
  - System can auto-generate if blank
- **Full Name**: 
  - Required field
  - Should contain only letters, spaces, and common name punctuation
  - Minimum length requirements
- **IC/Passport Number**:
  - Optional field
  - Format validation based on country standards
  - Uniqueness check to prevent duplicates
- **Phone Number**:
  - Optional field
  - Format validation for proper phone number structure
  - International format support

### Membership Data Validation
- **Membership Plan Name**:
  - Must match an existing plan in the system
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Fuzzy matching for minor typos
- **Membership Start Date**:
  - Required if including membership
  - Must be valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Cannot be in distant past (configurable threshold)
- **Membership End Date**:
  - Required if including membership
  - Must be valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Must be after start date
  - Should align with plan duration (warning if inconsistent)

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Frontend Components
- **FileUploader**: Handles file selection and initial processing
- **DataPreviewTable**: Interactive table for viewing and editing import data
- **ValidationSummary**: Displays validation statistics and issues
- **ColumnMapper**: Interface for matching CSV columns to database fields
- **ImportProgress**: Shows real-time progress during import

### Backend Processing
- **CSV Parser**: Converts CSV to structured data
- **Validation Engine**: Applies business rules to imported data
- **Database Operations**: Handles the actual import process
- **Error Handler**: Manages and reports import failures
- **Audit Logger**: Records import activities for compliance

## User Experience Considerations

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with simple interface showing just file upload
- Reveal additional options and details as user progresses
- Provide context-sensitive help at each step

### Error Recovery
- Allow users to go back to previous steps
- Preserve entered data between steps
- Provide clear guidance on resolving issues

### Performance Optimization
- Process large files in chunks to prevent UI blocking
- Show progress indicators for time-consuming operations
- Allow background processing with notification on completion

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Sanitize all imported data to prevent injection attacks
- Validate data types and formats before database insertion
- Enforce business rules consistently

### Access Control
- Restrict import functionality to authorized users
- Log all import activities with user attribution
- Implement rate limiting for import operations

### Data Protection
- Secure handling of potentially sensitive member information
- Option to encrypt sensitive fields in error reports
- Automatic cleanup of temporary import files

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Template Management**: Save and reuse import configurations
- **Scheduled Imports**: Set up recurring imports from external systems
- **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations during import
- **Import Profiles**: Different validation rules for different import types

### Integration Opportunities
- **API Integration**: Direct imports from third-party systems
- **Export-Import Workflow**: Seamless workflow between export and import
- **Notification System**: Alerts when imports complete or require attention

This comprehensive import workflow will significantly improve the data management capabilities of the system while ensuring data integrity and providing a user-friendly experience for administrators.
