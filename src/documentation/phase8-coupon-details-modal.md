# Phase 8: Coupon Details Modal & Enhanced Owner Display

## Overview
This phase implements a comprehensive coupon details modal that allows viewing and editing coupon information, along with enhanced display of coupon ownership including both member and walk-in customer names.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Coupon Details Modal (`CouponDetailsModal.tsx`)
- **Clickable Coupon Rows**: All coupon entries in the table are now clickable to open details
- **View/Edit Mode Toggle**: Switch between viewing and editing coupon information
- **Comprehensive Information Display**: Shows template info, usage statistics, and ownership details
- **Real-time Validation**: Live member search and validation during editing
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status badges for active/expired coupons

### 2. Enhanced Owner Display
- **Member Integration**: Shows member names when coupons are linked to member accounts
- **Walk-in Customer Support**: Displays customer names for non-member purchases
- **Fallback Display**: Shows "Walk-in customer" when no specific name is available
- **Database Schema Update**: Added `customer_name` column to `sold_coupons` table

### 3. Coupon Management Features
- **Editable Fields**: Code, owner, entries remaining, and expiry date
- **Member Search Integration**: Real-time member search with selection dropdown
- **Usage Tracking**: Displays total, used, and remaining entries
- **Expiry Monitoring**: Shows days until expiry with color-coded warnings

## Business Logic Implementation

### Coupon Ownership Hierarchy
```typescript
// Display priority for coupon ownership
1. Member Name (if member_id exists and member found)
2. Customer Name (if customer_name field populated)
3. "Walk-in customer" (fallback for anonymous purchases)
```

### Modal Interaction Flow
1. **Click to Open**: Any coupon row click opens the details modal
2. **View Mode**: Default read-only view with edit button
3. **Edit Mode**: Enables field editing with save/cancel options
4. **Member Search**: Real-time search with dropdown selection
5. **Save Changes**: Updates database and refreshes parent view

### Status Calculation
- **Active**: `entries_remaining > 0 && expiry_date > today`
- **Expired**: `entries_remaining <= 0 || expiry_date <= today`
- **Days Until Expiry**: Calculated dynamically with color coding

## Database Integration

### Schema Updates
```sql
-- Added customer_name column for walk-in customer tracking
ALTER TABLE sold_coupons ADD COLUMN customer_name text;
```

### Data Relationships
- **Member Link**: `sold_coupons.member_id → members.id`
- **Template Link**: `sold_coupons.template_id → coupon_templates.id`
- **Customer Name**: Direct storage in `sold_coupons.customer_name`

### Update Operations
- **Coupon Details**: Code, member assignment, entries, expiry date
- **Customer Assignment**: Link/unlink members, update customer names
- **Usage Tracking**: Modify remaining entries for corrections

## User Experience Features

### Intuitive Interface
- **Click Anywhere**: Entire table row is clickable for easy access
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states and cursor changes indicate clickability
- **Modal Design**: Clean, focused interface for coupon management
- **Responsive Layout**: Works well on different screen sizes

### Edit Workflow
1. **View Details**: Click any coupon to see comprehensive information
2. **Edit Mode**: Click "Edit" button to enable field modifications
3. **Member Search**: Type to search and select members for ownership
4. **Save Changes**: Confirm updates with validation feedback
5. **Auto-refresh**: Parent view updates automatically after changes

### Information Display
- **Template Information**: Shows original coupon template details
- **Usage Statistics**: Visual breakdown of entry usage
- **Ownership Details**: Clear display of who owns the coupon
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges and warnings

## Security & Validation

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: Coupon code and basic information validation
- **Member Verification**: Real member search and selection
- **Entry Limits**: Prevents negative or excessive entry counts
- **Date Validation**: Ensures valid expiry dates

### Error Handling
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of update failures
- **Search Errors**: Fallback for member search issues
- **Validation Errors**: Clear user feedback for invalid inputs
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms and error recovery

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Member Management**: Real-time member search and linking
- **Coupon Sales**: Enhanced customer name tracking
- **Transaction System**: Maintains transaction integrity
- **Audit System**: Complete change logging

### Future Enhancements
- **Usage History**: Track individual coupon entry usage
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass coupon management capabilities
- **Advanced Search**: Filter coupons by various criteria
- **Export Features**: Generate coupon reports and lists

## Technical Architecture

### Component Design
- **Modal Pattern**: Reusable modal component with proper state management
- **Search Integration**: Real-time member search with debouncing
- **Form Handling**: Controlled inputs with validation
- **State Management**: Efficient local state with React hooks

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Modal content loads only when opened
- **Search Optimization**: Debounced search to reduce API calls
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of search results
- **Update Efficiency**: Targeted database updates only for changed fields

### Error Boundaries
- **Component Isolation**: Modal errors don't affect parent components
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback displays for missing data
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with recovery options
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains data integrity during failures

This implementation provides a comprehensive coupon management interface that enhances the user experience while maintaining data integrity and providing clear ownership tracking for both member and walk-in customer purchases.
